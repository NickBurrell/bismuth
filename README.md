# Bismuth

Bismuth is a Visual Logic Design software targeting people either learning logic, or developing new forms of logic. It features a suite of tools useful for all logicians:

 - A simple programming language, named "NAME TBD", with syntax very similar to traditional semantic definitions used in most logic books
 - A visual graph editor, with multiple modes, to facilitate designing Kripke models for modal logic
 - A LaTeX pretty-printer, which allows users to visualize their "NAME TBD" code as either a family of inference rules, or traditional "semantic entailment" rules
